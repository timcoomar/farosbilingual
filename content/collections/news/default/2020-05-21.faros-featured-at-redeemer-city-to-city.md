Faros was featured at the Spring 2020 issue of [Redeemer City to City](https://redeemercitytocity.com/), a non-profit organization based in New York City that trains and connects Christian leaders throughout the world. 

Our co-founder, Patricia Kirk, had the opportunity to tell our story: how Faros was created in 2014, how it grew as a team, and how it became a safe haven for refugee children and youth in Athens. 

Love and care for each individual child are at the core of our approach. As Patricia said, _"we often return to the parable of the Good Samaritan, seeing ourselves as the innkeeper who received the wounded man. This is our calling: to serve and love the broken that God brings to our doorstep."_
