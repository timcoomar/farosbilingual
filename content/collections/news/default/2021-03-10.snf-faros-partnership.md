**Athens** - We are honored to announce our partnership with the Stavros Niarchos Foundation in the protection of homeless refugee children in Athens. SNF is supporting Faros’ street work program and our Drop-In-Center in Athens. 

In February 2021, there were 3.973 unaccompanied refugee children in Greece. More than 900 children were staying in “insecure housing conditions”, according to the National Center for Social Solidarity (EKKA). The real number, however, is much higher. 

Supporting unaccompanied refugee children have been at the heart of Faros’ mission since 2014. Our team has been dedicated to locating and bringing these children to safety. 

Our partnership with SNF aims to strengthen our activities towards unaccompanied children who experience homelessness. Faros’ street work team is combing the streets of Athens seeking and supporting them with immediate assistance, including food, hygiene materials, and support for housing. The outreach is connected to our Drop-in Center at Victoria Square, which provides a safe space and individualized support for homeless children and youth.
